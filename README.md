# Love-Running

This is a practise website project using basic hmtl5 and css. I have just completed my initial hmtl and css training and this project gives me an opportunity to put my new skills into practise.  No Grid or Flex just floats and clears to position content, use of media querries for responsiveness.

This project also serves as practise with working with GitHub, connecting, pushing and pulling from 3rd party IDE's.
